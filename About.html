      with leadership experience from being a part of the honors college and an Engineering College Ambassador</p>
    <br>
    <p>Catherine is currently a full time student and a part-time employee at Target. She has been with Target
      for a total of two years and has become experienced in multiple areas of the store's process. Most
      recently she has been working as an online order fulfillment team member allowing her the chance to work

      allows her to interact with guests and help them with their needs.</p>

    <p>Catherine is passionate about learning to be a successful leader and loves to learn new things that allow
      her to be an effective student and employee. She believes working in a team with a healthy amount of
      communication is the key for success which is why she is always trying to be involved in clubs and
      activities that allow her to do just that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Catherine has loved being a customer service advocate and employee since she was 16, but she knows it's
      time to take a step towards her future career as a software engineer. She wants to have the opportunity
      to apply the knowledge she's learned these past two years, and is ready for a real challenge.
      She has the work ethic, now it's just application. She is currently open to internship positions!</p>
